## Description

Supercharge your money by tracking every transaction and viewing statistics about them!

Features:
- Track each income and expense transaction
- View graphs and reports about your transactions
- Organize transactions into customizable categories
- Seamless integration with Shortcuts to create workflows
- And more!

## Technical Stuff

This app uses the Swift Data framework to store your transactions. Each transaction and each category is a model in Swift Data.

To display the charts on the Stats page, Swift Charts is used. It's actually super easy to use :-)

`@AppStorage` (aka UserDefaults) was used to store small amounts of data (such as the chosen currency).

The app also adopts the App Intents framework for integration with the Shortcuts app. You can create shortcuts that search for transactions and categories and add transactions. More actions are coming soon!
